<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;">Habitat And Adaptation</h1>

<h3 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;">Habitat</h3>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 32px; margin-bottom: 30px;">A habitat is the natural environment where a plant, animal, or other organism lives and grows.<br>It provides all the basic needs for survival, including food, water, shelter, and space.<br>Different organisms live in different types of habitats depending on their needs—forests, oceans, deserts, wetlands, and grasslands are all examples.<br> Each habitat supports a unique community of species that are specially adapted to live there.<br>For example, camels are suited for desert habitats, while frogs thrive in wetlands.<br>The loss or destruction of habitats due to human activities like deforestation, pollution, and urbanization is one of the biggest threats to biodiversity.<br> Protecting habitats is essential for the survival of countless species and the health of the planet.

<hr>

<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;">Types of Habitat</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 32px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Many animals and plant are adapted to different habitat.<br>There are multiple types of Habitat.<br>Let us study them.

<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;">Terrestrial Habitat</h1>

<h1 style="font-size:35px; text-align:center;">Desert Habitat</h1>

<img style"width: 20%;" src="Material/Image21.jpeg">
<img style"width: 20%;" src="Material/Image22.jpeg">
<img style"width: 20%;" src="Material/Image23.jpeg">


<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 32px; margin-bottom: 30px;">A desert habitat is a dry and often hot environment where very little rainfall occurs throughout the year.<br>Despite the harsh conditions, deserts are home to many specially adapted plants and animals.<br>Cacti, for example, have thick stems to store water and spines instead of leaves to reduce water loss.<br>Animals like camels, lizards, snakes, and foxes survive in deserts by being active mostly at night, staying cool during the day, and needing very little water.<br>The temperature in deserts can be extremely high during the day and drop sharply at night.<br>Although deserts may look empty, they are full of life that has adapted in amazing ways to survive in such a tough environment.Protecting desert ecosystems is important because they are fragile and take a long time to recover if damaged.

<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;">Adaptation</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 32px; margin-bottom: 30px;">To survive in these habitat many animals have different adaptation.<br>for each habitat animals have different adaptation like animals is desert have different adaptation than rainforest.<br> let us study about them.

<h1 style="font-size:35px; text-align:center;">Adaptation for plants and animals in desert</h1>

<img style"width: 20%;" src="Material/Image21.jpeg">
<img style"width: 20%;" src="Material/Image22.jpeg">

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 32px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Animals that live in the desert have special adaptations to survive the extreme heat and dry conditions.<br>Since water is very scarce, many desert animals can go for long periods without drinking and get moisture from the food they eat.<br>Camels are well-known desert animals that store fat in their humps, which can be used for energy and water when food is not available.<br>Many desert animals, like foxes and snakes, are nocturnal, meaning they stay active at night when it is cooler.<br>Some animals, such as the fennec fox, have large ears that help release heat and keep their bodies cool.<br>Lizards and insects often have light-colored bodies to reflect sunlight and avoid overheating.<br>Burrowing is another common behavior; animals like rodents dig tunnels to escape the heat and find shelter underground.<br>These adaptations are important for survival in the harsh desert environment, where temperatures can change quickly and food is limited.

<h1 style="font-size:35px; text-align:center;">Adaptation for plants and animals in Grassland</h1>

<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;">Types of seeds</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 32px; margin-bottom: 30px;">There are two kinds of seed monocot and dicot.<br>let us study them.

<h1 style="font-size:35px; text-align:center;">Dicot seed</h1>

<img style"width: 20%;" src="Material/Image1001.jpeg">

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 32px; margin-bottom: 30px;">A dicot seed is a type of seed that contains two cotyledons, or seed leaves.<br>The outer covering of the seed is called the seed coat, which protects the inner parts.<br>Inside the seed, there is an embryo that consists of three main parts: the radicle, hypocotyl, and epicotyl.<br>The radicle is the part that develops into the root.<br>The hypocotyl connects the radicle to the epicotyl and forms the lower part of the stem.<br>The epicotyl is the part that gives rise to the shoot system of the plant.<br>The cotyledons store food for the growing seedling and provide energy during germination.<br>This type of seed is commonly found in plants like beans, peas, and sunflower

<h1 style="font-size:35px; text-align:center;">Monocot seed</h1>

<img style"width: 20%;" src="Material/Image1002.jpeg">

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 32px; margin-bottom: 30px;">A monocot seed contains only one cotyledon, which helps to absorb food from the endosperm.<br>The seed coat protects the inner parts of the seed from damage and drying out.<br>The endosperm is a large, food-storing tissue that supplies energy to the growing embryo.<br>The embryo consists of the radicle, hypocotyl, and epicotyl.<br>The radicle grows into the root system of the plant.<br>The hypocotyl connects the radicle and epicotyl and helps in pushing the shoot above the soil.<br>The epicotyl grows into the shoot system, including the stem and leaves.<br>Monocot seeds, like corn and wheat, are common in grasses and cereal crops.
